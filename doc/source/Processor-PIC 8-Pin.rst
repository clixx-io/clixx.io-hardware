PIC 8-Pin
=========

The Digital Button is a handy general purpose button board. 

It can be used in any circuit requiring a button and can be mounted either
directly to the circuit board via a digital or analog input.

Any programming language can be used depending on your platform and the
button works as a Digital Input device meaning that a value of 0 indicates
off and a non-zero value means that the button is depressed.

You can typically add more than one Digital Button to a circuit and
combine them with other electronics such as LED's or switches to make
them do useful tasks.

About Clixx.io
==============

.. image:: images/make-a-circuit-in-seconds-01.png

Clixx.io is a 5-wire system developed by David Lyon for prototyping
and building small computer systems easily and quickly. In fact
most of the parts just click together and then become ready
for programming.

There's a good range of standard boards providing most of the
basic components that would be needed to build most types of
small hobby projects.

Going beyond what we provide is the fun part! The wiring diagrams
of our system are all Open Source and well documented. So it's
one of the easiest systems on the planet to build for and extend.

We've designed all the boards to work in multiple ways. They can
sit flat, sit vertical, be screwed to a wall, as well as work on
multiple types of processor boards such as the Arduino and Raspberry-Pi.

We hope you'll discover the usefulness as well as the fun of this
incredible collection of componentry and get the project that you've
been wanting to get made completed and operational with clixx.io

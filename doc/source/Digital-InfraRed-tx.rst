InfraRed Transmitter
--------------------

InfraRed remotes are found in most consumer electronics such
as Televisions, Video Recorders and Air-Conditioners.

You can use this board to talk to those devices. It will modulate
the signal off the pin into an InfraRed signal that can be picked
up by the appliance.

There is also an InfraRed Receiver board allowing you to use a
Transmitter and Receiver pair.

Rotary Gauge
============

.. image:: images/Display-rotaryled.png

The Rotary Gauge is a twin-tab board that has 9 LED's that can
be used in various applications where some sort of rotary gauge
might be needed. This might include:

 - Temperature Gauge

 - Speed Gauge

 - Voltage Gauge

 - Engine RPM Gauge or anything else.

Introduction
------------

This board is based around the Phillips PCF-8574 I2C Shift-Register.

A Shift Register is a chip which takes a Serial Input, and then converts
that serial byte onto a set of pins in sequential order.

In this Gauge, the Blue LED is used to show that power is on. After that
each of the other colours (green, white, orange and red) come on depending
to the value that is received from the Microprocessor.

Each bit of the Shift-Register then maps out onto the following LED
of the Gauge:

    ==== ============= ==========
    Bit  Hex           Color
    ==== ============= ==========
    1    0x01          Green
    2    0x02          Green
    3    0x04          White
    4    0x08          White
    3    0x10          Orange
    4    0x20          Orange
    3    0x40          Red
    4    0x80          Red

Installation
------------

This board is based on the I2C Standard and can be installed simply by
inserting it into one of the I2C connectors.

By default the board is configured to exist at the I2C address of 0x3F.

On a Linux board, such as the Raspberry-Pi, you will need to install I2C
modules and drivers and that process is described >here<. 

.. code-block:: python

    #!/usr/bin/wpy

    import time
    import smbus
    import ClixxIO_I2C

    g = None
    device_num = 0x3E
    TIMEFORMAT = "%m/%d/%y %H:%M:%S"
    INTERVAL = 2

    def getTimeList():
        statFile = file("/proc/stat", "r")
        timeList = statFile.readline().split(" ")[2:6]
        statFile.close()
        for i in range(len(timeList))  :
            timeList[i] = int(timeList[i])
        return timeList

    def deltaTime(interval)  :
        x = getTimeList()
        time.sleep(interval)
        y = getTimeList()
        for i in range(len(x))  :
            y[i] -= x[i]
        return y

    def setup():
        global g
        g = ClixxIO_I2C.displayRotaryLeds(0x3F,1)

    def loop():
        global g
        dt = deltaTime(INTERVAL)
        timeStamp = time.strftime(TIMEFORMAT)
        cpuPct = 100 - (dt[len(dt) - 1] * 100.00 / sum(dt))
        print timeStamp + "\t" + str('%.4f' %cpuPct)          

        g.display(int(cpuPct),100)

        time.sleep(0.2)
